## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Been a while since I build Front End Manager. I learned a lot how to import and use bootstrap 5 and use Javascript to validate the input email.

### Continued development

There are a lot of things I should cover later. Like the size of image on hero section is too big on Mobile Screen. Also, a lot of adjustment on how i write the HTML and CSS (it's not really pretty to see), improve the consistency of the color and size of each component, and fix the design tablet in tablet mode.
